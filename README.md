# AudioAnalyzer
My Thesis Project

This is an application for analyzing audiofiles, It is able to provide spectrograms and tempographs of songs, and get spotify data based on the name of the file,
It is also able to separate the file into two different wave files if it contains 2 channels, It uses spleeter and tensorflow to separate the vocals from the accompaniement.

The Heroku branch is used for deploying the application on the web at: sounravel.herokuapp.com
It can currently analyze files up to 40 seconds long, 
However this does not contain the file separator functionality due to this using a lot of memory and currently only owning a free account of Heroku.
Heroku times out after 30 seconds, which is a problem because analyzing 3-4 minute wavfiles takes longer especially if it has 2 channels

TODO: Flush memory from time to time.
TODO: Implement spleeter somehow.(has to do with using heroku dynos efficiently and memory management on Heroku)

The main Branch has all functionality and works with files no matter how long, the only problem is spleeter leaving behind a couple of alien threads that do not terminate.
This means that after about 5-6 files analyzed the application runs out of memory and crashes...

TODO: Fix spleeter crashes.

STARTING THE APPLICATION:

Add the following ENV Variables:
SOUNRAVEL_MONGO_URI = <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas (FREE) and just link it>
SPOTIFY_ID = https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/
SPOTIFY_SECRET = https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/

Install requirements with: <pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt>

Start application with: <python app.py>

FUTURE ACTIVITY:
- Checkbox for what the user wants for speeding up application if not every detail is needed
- Make footer dissapear when uploading
- Spleeter error fix
- Forgot Password functionality
- Mobile Version
- Using the separated Vocal file and submiting it to a transcription service like Amazon Transcribe or Googleâ€™s equivalent and voila, autogenerated lyrics.
